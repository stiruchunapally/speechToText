# Speech to Text bot

## What is it?

A simple python bot that when given a .wav file, uses Google's speech recognition api to translate the words spoken into text and display them in a 
webpage, formatted and hosted using Flask and CSS.


## Note
In order to run this application, both flask and the speech_recognition libraries must be present on the machine.
